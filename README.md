End-to-end transport performance analytics project using Python, PostgreSQL, SQL, and Power BI, focused on Canberra public transport reliability and service efficiency.


# Transport Canberra Performance Analysis

Project Overview
This project delivers an end-to-end analysis of public transport performance in Canberra using real-world service data.  
The objective is to uncover reliability trends, peak congestion periods, and route-level performance insights to support data-driven operational and planning decisions.

The project follows a full analytics lifecycle: data ingestion, cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and executive-level visualisation in Power BI.

Objectives
- Analyse service reliability across routes, days, and time periods
- Identify peak-hour congestion and delay patterns
- Compare service frequency versus performance
- Present insights through a single-page executive Power BI dashboard

Tools & Technologies
- Python(Pandas, NumPy)
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- **Power BI**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
